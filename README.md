**Terms and Conditions**

You are hiring Wayne Stratton, located in Raleigh, North Carolina for an iOS iPhone web wrapper application design and/or development project for the estimated total price outlined in our previous correspondence.

**1.0 Services Rendered**

DESIGN

Since this application is based on the mobile styling of your WordPress website, the application design is prodomentally based on an application wrapper that follows iOS best practices and then the mobile styling of your WordPress website. In an effort to be accepted by the App Store, we will make our best effort to standardize the mobile design of your website to fit iOS standards.

GRAPHICS/PHOTOGRAPHS

You'll need to supply any custom graphics files to us in an editable, vector digital format. Photographs must be in a high-resolution digital format. If you choose to buy stock photographs, we can suggest stock libraries and style of photography/images. If you'd like us to search for photographs for you, we can provide a separate estimate for that. Cost of buying stock photographs or a photo shoot is not included in this contract.

IPHONE APPLICATION

We'll design and develop an iOS iPhone web wrapper application for your WordPress powered website. This includes device support for iPhone 6 and 6+, iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S+, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X. This does not include any other legacy iPhone/iPod devices, nor does it include any iPad devices. If you would like an iPad application created or support for legacy devices, we can supply a seperate estimate for that. 

DEVICE TESTING

Device testing no longer means attempting to make an application look the same in all devices of different capabilities or on devices with different size screens. It does mean ensuring that a person's experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of the device.


CHANGES AND REVISIONS

We know from experience that fixed-price contracts are rarely beneficial to you, as they often limit you to your earliest ideas. We don't want to limit your ability to change your mind or make decisions later when you might be better informed. The price at the beginning of this contract is based on the length of time we estimate we'll need to accomplish everything you've told us you want to achieve, but we're happy to be flexible. If you want to change your mind or add anything new, that won't be a problem as we'll provide a separate estimate for to cover the additional work.

ERRORS AND APP STORE ACCEPTANCE

We can't guarantee that our work will be error-free (we're human!) so we can't be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you've advised us of them. 

We can't gaurentee acceptance of your application by the App Store. There are many WebView based apps available in the App Store, but acceptance is largely based upon the QC reviewer. We will add a limited set of native functions that work with your WordPress powered website as outlined in our prior coorespondence in an effort to ensure the application is accepted by the App Store but this is again, not gauranteed. 

If we require more features to be added outside of the work already agreed upon in our prior coorespondence to be accepted into the App Store, we can provide a seperate estimate for that when that information is provided to us by the App Store review process. 

**2.0 Mutual Cooperation**

We agree to use our best efforts to fulfill and exceed your expectation on the deliverables listed above. You agree to aid us in doing so by making available to us needed information pertaining to your website and to cooperate with us in expediting the work.

**3.0 Charges for Services Performed**

Functionality or feature requests above and beyond those listed in the budget and/or the functionality specs may be considered out-of-scope and an amendment to the budget will be recommended. Projects that go dormant for longer than 45 days will incur a $450 restart fee plus an upfront payment of the remaining balance to resume work at the discretion of Wayne Stratton. Any project that remains incomplete 120 days from the start date will be canceled with all payments forfeited to Wayne Stratton.

**4.0 Terms of Payment**

4.1 BILLING SCHEDULE

We are a small business, and we're sure you understand how important it is that you pay the invoices that we send you promptly. We're also sure you'll want to maintain a positive working relationship and keep the project moving forward, so you agree to stick tight to the following payment schedule. For design and development projects, Wayne Stratton will invoice you for fifty percent (75%) of the initial fees at the point of your accepted estimate, which will act as the deposit. Deposits are non-refundable. ***The remaining balance (25%) will be due prior to launch of the completed project.*** Smaller projects will be invoiced for 100% of the total cost before any services are performed.

4.2 CLIENT AGREEMENT TO PAY

You agree to pay our initial (1st) invoice upon receipt which will act as a deposit for design or development projects or a full payment for smaller projects. In the event payment is not made within 7 days, Wayne Stratton will charge a late payment fee of 5% per week on any overdue and unpaid balance not in dispute, to cover the manpower, interest, and other costs Wayne Stratton pays for carrying overdue invoices. In addition, Wayne Stratton reserves the right to stop work until payment is received. 

4.3 COLLECTION COSTS

In the event that we incur legal fees, costs and disbursements in an effort to collect our invoices, in addition to interest on the unpaid balance, you agree to reimburse us for these expenses.

**5.0 Cancellation of Plans**

You have the right to modify, reject, cancel or stop any and all plans or work in process. However, you agree to reimburse us for all costs and expenses we incurred prior to your change in instructions, and which relate to non-cancelable commitments, and to defend, indemnify and hold us harmless for any liability relating to such action. We agree to use our best efforts to minimize such costs and expenses. All payments and deposits made to Wayne Stratton are non-refundable.

We'll give you source files and finished files upon request and you should keep them somewhere safe as we're not required to keep a copy. You own all elements of text, images, and data you provided unless someone else owns them. We'll own the unique combination of these elements that constitute a complete design and we'll license that to you, exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only, unless we agree otherwise.
